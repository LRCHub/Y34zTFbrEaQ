Every painting of a Mother
Every drawing of a Daughter
Brothers Sisters we love make the world go round

Every same old silly love song
Every movie too long
All the mess that we miss
Reminisce, please rest in peace

If I told you that I need you
Would you stay with me til I'm true？
Like a sinner's repent, a beggar's plea

Every soldier has a reason
Everyday we listen
Oh the Timeless only whispers the words of wisdom

Oh let me help you with your burdens
I'll carry you
Just you send me down your shivers all down my spine
Like the changing of the seasons
We'll be back again to where we started
So don't you ever worry anymore

If a journey has an ending
Would you know by how it started？
Like a father too proud, a love so blind

Every shade of gray a color
Every moment a life
Oh the Timeless tells a story

Let me help you with your burdens
I'll carry you
Just you send me down your shivers all down my spine
Like the changing of the seasons
We'll be back again to where we started
So don't you ever worry anymore

思いっきり生きれるように
最後の歌のように

今だけの時間を大切な時間を
